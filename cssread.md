# Design web pages with CSS


CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it.

You can make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

Color can really bring your pages to life. Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.
