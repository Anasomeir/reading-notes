### Hardware and Software

hardware like circuits **chips wires speakers plugs** ets...
software can be anything in the computer programs or code running on this machine software can be anything from apps, games, website, maps.

**CPU** is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.

**operating system** the master program, that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer
last but not least the programmer can make the computer smart, when the programmer learn the code you get to define the problem you want to solve and write the software that turns those ideas into reality.
