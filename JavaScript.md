# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

Web developers usually using three languages that are used to create web pages:**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
A JavaScript file is just a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has a . j s file extension]]

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 

Statements should end with a semicolon. The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter
when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
